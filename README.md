# Human Development Analysis

## Introduction

The Human Development Report (HDR) dataset is a comprehensive collection of data related to various aspects of human development across the world. Compiled and published annually by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), this dataset provides a wealth of information on key indicators such as life expectancy, education levels, income, and other socioeconomic factors. It covers a wide range of countries and territories, allowing for cross-country comparisons and analysis of trends over time.
